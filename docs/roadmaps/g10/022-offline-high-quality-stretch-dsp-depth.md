# 022 - OfflineHighQuality Stretch DSP Depth

Status: ready
Owner: dsp
Created: 2026-07-07
Depends on: g10.021
Vision tags: `DSP`, `STRETCH`, `QUALITY`

## Problem

OfflineHighQuality has a clean-room foundation: phase-vocoder baseline,
identity phase locking, transient reset behavior, linked stereo, static pitch
composition, dynamic ratio segments, and cacheable render/export/freeze
artifacts. It is still a foundation, not the final quality tier. The next
implementation work should target audible quality weaknesses found by the
comparison reports, not add more receipt or fixture surfaces.

## Goals

- [x] run the current comparison and quality-priority reports before choosing
  each algorithm change
- [x] choose one top measured weakness per batch: transient smear, loop seams,
  sustained phasiness, stereo image drift, pitch error, or timing drift
- [ ] add a multiresolution or hybrid STFT/time-domain path when the measured
  weakness justifies it
- [ ] improve transient anchoring or local time-domain splice behavior for
  percussive material
- [ ] improve vertical coherence for dense sustained and polyphonic material
- [ ] improve loop-seam handling under fixed ratios and dynamic ratio segments
- [ ] add static-pitch quality evidence across vocals, bass, and full mixes
- [x] keep `PhaseVocoderStretcher` as the draft baseline for regression
  comparison

## Execution Plan

### Batch 22.1 - Measured Weakness Selection

- [x] run synthetic comparison and quality-priority reports
- [x] record the top target and the rejected alternatives before coding

### Batch 22.2 - First Quality Improvement

- [x] implement one DSP change against the selected target
- [x] prove the chosen metric improves or holds without creating a higher
  priority regression

### Batch 22.3 - Multiresolution Or Hybrid Path

- [ ] add the next engine path only when a measured weakness requires it
- [ ] keep the lower-complexity path available for regression comparison

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] every DSP batch names the metric or listening failure it targets
- [x] OfflineHighQuality improves or holds against the draft baseline on the
  chosen target and does not create a higher-priority regression elsewhere
- [x] output length and deterministic cache identity behavior remain stable
- [x] no realtime audio-thread path calls whole-buffer stretch processing

## Validation

- `cargo test -p signal-dsp-stretch`
- focused synthetic and real-corpus report runs

## Progress

- 2026-07-07: opened as active g10 OfflineHighQuality DSP quality work after
  the stretch policy/fixture line was judged mature enough and further
  proof-shaping was called out as churn.
- 2026-07-07: ran `stretch-corpus-report` with
  `projection:g10.022-selection`. No operator licensed material or external
  renders were present, so real-report evidence remains an operator input.
  Synthetic comparison had no regressions or inconclusive rows. The selected
  residual target was dynamic-ratio segment seam click:
  `stretch:tempo_ramp` reported OfflineHighQuality seam click at `-16.814012`
  dBFS despite improving draft `-4.908878` dBFS. Rejected alternatives:
  pitch error was already below one cent, loop fixed-ratio click was already
  silent on measured joins, stereo image deltas were near zero, and sustained
  coherence already improved draft.
- 2026-07-07: implemented offline dynamic-ratio segment-boundary smoothing for
  linked stereo and dynamic-ratio pitch paths. Output length and deterministic
  behavior stayed stable. The selected synthetic seam metric improved to
  `-240.000000` dBFS with no new higher-priority regression in the comparison
  report.
- 2026-07-07: reran the report with the no-listening FMA review seed. Real
  source coverage was present (`operator_listening_sources=10`,
  `missing_assets=0`), but it still provided no subjective or decoded
  real-audio quality metric. Synthetic comparison had no regressions or
  inconclusive rows. External rendered-output comparison could not be collected
  locally because `rubberband`, `ffmpeg`, and `sox` were not installed.
- 2026-07-07: rejected a narrow compression transient-reset change. Enabling
  transient phase resets for ratios below 1.0 changed synthetic extreme-ratio
  transient smear at `0.5x` and `0.75x` from OfflineHighQuality `8`/`6` frames
  back to the draft `1024` frame value, so no DSP patch landed.
- 2026-07-07: added opt-in decoded listening-source profiling to
  `stretch-corpus-report`. The FMA review seed now emits ten decoded MP3 source
  rows with sample rate, channel count, analyzed frames, peak/RMS,
  zero-crossing rate, and transient density. This is source-profile evidence,
  not a stretch-quality verdict.
- 2026-07-07: added opt-in decoded real-source stretch metric rows to
  `stretch-corpus-report`. `--measure-decoded-stretch` now compares the draft
  phase-vocoder baseline with OfflineHighQuality on bounded decoded local
  excerpts for timing drift and transient smear across each listening-source
  case ratio. This creates real-audio objective evidence before any listened
  curation or external comparator render is available.

## Next Task

Do not add a multiresolution or hybrid path until measured evidence requires
it. Next useful work is to inspect the decoded real-source metric rows for the
largest OfflineHighQuality regressions, then choose one DSP change or corpus
expansion from that evidence. Listened real-source curation and external
rendered-output comparison remain promotion inputs.
