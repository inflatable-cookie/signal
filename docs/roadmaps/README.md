# Roadmaps

Status: active
Updated: 2026-03-14

## Why this section matters now

Roadmaps turn the Signal library/runtime strategy into executable batches.

## Scope

Use this section for:

- active implementation milestones
- generation control
- backlog and deferred work

## Layout

- `g*/`: generation roadmaps and closure records
- `generation-index.md`: generation history and rollover notes
- `backlog/`: deferred work only
- `templates/`: roadmap authoring support

## Current posture

`g06` is now active and `g07` is now seeded as the next planned generation.
`g01` established the Rust workspace, engine, host/device
path, and plugin/runtime baseline; `g02` completed the first reusable DSP and
deep-analysis expansion on top of that foundation; `g03` completed the next
engine-oriented runtime depth queue; `g04` completed the reusable contract,
scheduling, portability, conformance, and release-baseline queue; `g05`
completed the widened backend, host-edge, publication-packaging,
downstream-automation, and generation-closeout queue; and `g06` now opens the
next deeper Signal-owned runway around runtime recovery, instrumentation,
plugin-format breadth, MIDI/event expansion, hardware and external-I/O depth,
media-service depth, and shared acceptance evidence that will tangibly move
Loophole forward. `g07` is already laid out behind it for the next major
feature-expansion queue.

The previously completed continuation runway was:

- shared streaming spectral and resampling substrate
- rhythm structure and tempo continuity depth
- tonal and harmonic analysis depth
- loudness and dynamics depth
- transient/timbral descriptor packs
- embedding and benchmark hardening

The newly completed continuation runway was:

- routed mixer graph, buses, and topology depth
- runtime metering, loudness, and diagnostics export
- automation playback and control-resolution depth
- tempo-map, warp, clip-processing, and render substrate
- plugin device-chain execution, latency compensation, and state recall
- offline render, freeze, and stem export pipeline
- profiling, soak harnesses, and runtime hardening

The latest completed continuation runway was:

- crate/public-contract maturity and schema-freeze baseline
- multicore scheduling and anticipative execution depth
- runtime work orchestration and deferred-service policy
- hardware backend portability and clock-domain boundary depth
- plugin backend breadth and host-neutral delegation contracts
- consumer conformance, export stability, and release packaging

The latest completed continuation runway was:

- backend-neutral plugin capability and adapter breadth baseline
- shared host convenience API and consumer-edge contracts
- publication-grade packaging manifests and release automation receipts
- downstream conformance soak and release-acceptance automation
- generation closeout and promotion gate

The newly active continuation runway is:

- runtime interruption, resumability, and recovery truth
- profiling, causal diagnostics, and deferred-work orchestration
- VST3 and AU adapter breadth plus richer generic MIDI/event semantics
- hardware supervision, external I/O, monitoring, and loopback depth
- media indexing, waveform analysis, preview, and metadata services
- fault injection, long-session soak, and Loophole-facing runtime readiness

The next planned continuation runway after `g06` is:

- spatial, multichannel, sidechain, and complex plugin-I/O depth
- LV2 plus deeper Linux plugin and hardware backend breadth
- external MIDI, control-surface, and advanced hardware device substrate
- fuller sample-domain time-stretch and transform-service depth

## Working Rule

- keep one active queue
- log by meaningful batch
- move deferred scope into backlog instead of leaving it half-active

## Next Task

Continue `g06.005` with Batch 5.2 by turning the new fault-cause contract into
typed runtime, supervisor, and stable host-edge diagnostic receipts before the
later profiling, plugin-breadth, hardware, media-service, and acceptance lanes
widen further.
