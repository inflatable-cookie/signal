# Offline Time-Stretch Synthesis

Status: active successor architecture
Owner: dsp
Updated: 2026-07-10
Contract refs: `046`, `082`
Roadmap ref: `g10.029`

## Current Boundary

The production OfflineHighQuality prototype remains the current `2048/512`
identity-lock/reset phase vocoder. The rejected report-only hybrid renders
independent short, current, and long STFT outputs. It is evidence, not the
successor architecture.

## Successor Shape

The successor candidate owns one sample-domain time map and one whole-band STFT
reconstruction.

- fixed-resolution analysis estimates centered time and frequency derivatives
  of the analyzed STFT phase
- a magnitude-prioritized heap integrates that full phase gradient across time
  and frequency
- every significant bin receives synthesis phase exactly once from the
  strongest available horizontal or vertical predecessor
- no peak tracker, onset detector, reset schedule, component mask, independent
  component synthesis, or local timing compensation enters the first proof
- boundary padding, normalized overlap-add, exact cropping, and identity bypass
  remain common synthesis policy

## State Ownership

One fixed-ratio mono engine owns:

- source and output frame cursors
- one fixed STFT geometry and global ratio
- current and adjacent analyzed complex frames
- time- and frequency-direction phase derivatives
- previous and current synthesis phase
- significant-bin membership and a bounded max heap
- deterministic insignificant-bin phase
- exact output-length and crop state

Linked stereo later shares the time map and phase-propagation decisions.
Channels retain their own complex spectra and phase gradients. Independent
per-channel heap topology is not an acceptable stereo path.

Dynamic ratio remains outside the successor until fixed-ratio mono and linked
stereo pass. Its eventual path must update the same time map continuously; it
must not concatenate independent renders.

## Staged Proof

1. current-grid adaptive transient timeline — rejected after timing and
   combined-gate failure
2. fixed-map peak transient proof — rejected after crest, placement, spectrum,
   and combined-gate failure
3. iterative H/R/P separation and exact reconstruction proof
4. additive H/R/P fixed-ratio mono candidate
5. fixed-resolution full phase-gradient kernel proof
6. whole-band full phase-gradient fixed-ratio mono gate
7. shared-decision linked stereo
8. concealed listening and dynamic-ratio checkpoint

Each stage stays report-only until the complete gate passes. A mechanism proof
may authorize the next stage but cannot promote product quality alone.

## Rejected Shapes

- independently rendered STFT branches joined by waveform crossfade
- bounded delay alignment between those branches
- global removal of identity locking
- scalar phase-lock or long-window selector sweeps
- fixed tail envelopes or hidden output padding
- local unity-ratio attack islands with steady-interval compensation
- two-way H/P processing that forces ambiguous content into a specialized path
- additive H/R/P TSM after its complete mono gate failed
- WSOLA as the next full-band path

## Separation Boundary

Contract `082` freezes a refined H/R/P decomposition. Long-resolution analysis
extracts only clearly harmonic bins. Short-resolution analysis extracts only
clearly percussive bins from the complement. The residual owns everything
ambiguous. Binary complement masks and normalized inverse STFT must prove exact
source reconstruction before component TSM opens.

This boundary is retained as proven historical evidence. Additive component TSM
failed and is not the active successor shape.

## Phase-Gradient Boundary

Contract `082` freezes the first active successor proof. It uses a
`4092`-sample Hann window, `8192`-point FFT, fixed `1024`-sample synthesis hop,
and nearest-integer analysis hop derived from the ratio. Centered finite
differences estimate both components of the analyzed phase gradient. A bounded
max heap integrates phase with the published trapezoidal rules.

The implementation operates on the nonredundant spectrum and mirrors synthesis
coefficients to enforce real output. The first frame keeps analyzed phase.
Bins below the frame-pair relative tolerance keep analyzed phase instead of
receiving random values. These are deterministic Signal boundary choices, not
claims about the reference implementation.

## Next Task

Reassess the successor after the whole-band phase-gradient candidate improved
tonal and comparator evidence but failed attack crest, placement, replica,
formant, integrity, and combined gates. Keep linked stereo, dynamic ratio, and
product routing closed.
