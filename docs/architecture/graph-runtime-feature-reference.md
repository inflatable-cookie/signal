## Purpose

Document the graph-execution and runtime functionality that is implemented
today in the Rust workspace. This complements the DSP/analysis reference by
describing the current executable graph, scheduler-facing planning, runtime
control state, and supervisor-facing observation surfaces.

## Scope Summary

The implemented graph/runtime surface currently lives in these crates:

- `signal-graph`
- `signal-runtime`

This file is implementation-facing. It describes code paths and public result
surfaces that exist under `crates/` today, not roadmap intent.

## Graph Execution

### `signal-graph`

Primary surface:

- `GraphExecutionPlan`
- `ExecutableGraph`
- `GraphExecutionRequest`
- `GraphBlockReport`

Current stage model:

- stage specs:
  - `Gain`
  - `Bias`
  - `TanhDrive`
  - `StereoBalance`
  - `HardClip`
  - `LowPass`
  - `Delay`
- execution classes:
  - `PureTransform`
  - `Stateful`
  - `LatencyBearing`
  - `PluginBacked`

Current graph features:

- node-based execution plans with explicit node ids, stage stacks, latency, and
  tail metadata
- buffer contracts per node:
  - input and output bus ids
  - channel layouts
  - scratch-buffer counts
  - silence policy
  - channel adaptation mode
  - reset policy
- topology metadata per node:
  - role
  - lane id
  - bus-group id
- contract validation and contract summaries
- routed bus execution with:
  - direct edges
  - fan-in bus mixing
  - fan-out bus propagation
  - output latency and tail aggregation
- adaptive mono/stereo channel conversion for compatible contracts
- silence handling through process, bypass, or clear-output policies

### Planning And Dispatch

Current planning behavior:

- maps nodes into planning groups:
  - `InlineRealtime`
  - `StatefulRealtime`
  - `AnticipativeEligible`
- derives lane order from those groups:
  - `Anticipative`
  - `Realtime`
- emits dispatch summaries for phase and lane boundaries
- records planning summaries in block reports

Current execution behavior:

- processes blocks through an explicit `GraphExecutionContext`
- carries:
  - processing epoch
  - block sequence
  - projection epoch
  - parameter epoch
  - configured block size
  - anticipative-enabled flag
  - transport-playing flag
  - transport tempo
  - timeline position
- supports a prepared-dispatch concept through `GraphPreparedDispatch`
- reports whether work was prepared ahead of realtime and then handed off

### Parameter Event Application

Current graph parameter surface:

- `GraphParameterTarget`
- `GraphParameterEvent`
- `GraphParameterBatch`
- `GraphParameterApplicationStrategy::SplitAtEvents`

Current behavior:

- parameter events are block-local and sample-offset based
- targets identify a node, stage index, and stage parameter
- event application currently supports split-at-events processing with a capped
  sub-block count
- unsupported or mismatched events are counted rather than crashing execution
- block reports include:
  - parameter event count
  - targeted node count
  - ignored event count
  - sub-block count
  - coalesced event count

Current stage parameters:

- gain linear
- bias amount
- tanh drive
- stereo balance
- hard-clip threshold
- low-pass cutoff
- delay feedback

### Graph Output Surface

`GraphBlockReport` currently exposes:

- node/execution-class counts
- contract/routing summary counts
- planning phase and lane order
- dispatch counts and order
- dynamic-kernel stage counts
- latency and tail maxima
- parameter application summary
- frame and channel counts
- input, prepared-dispatch, realtime-input, and output peak metrics
- output RMS and first output sample

Current constraints:

- block execution is still offline/in-memory rather than a dedicated realtime
  scheduler thread model
- channel adaptation is limited to mono/stereo cases
- stage catalog is intentionally small and host-independent
- plugin-backed nodes are represented in planning and reporting, but graph is
  not itself a plugin host

## Runtime Orchestration

### `signal-runtime`

Primary surface:

- `SignalRuntime`
- `RuntimeConfig`
- runtime-host interfaces under `interfaces.rs`

Current runtime features:

- embeddable runtime profiles:
  - `Local`
  - `Server`
- handshake, configure, start, stop, restart, and safe-mode control
- graph projection receipt and projection epoch tracking
- schedule, transport, parameter-batch, and plugin-binding application
- runtime-owned execution of `signal-graph` blocks
- runtime-owned engine, control, timeline, automation, diagnostics, and
  supervision snapshots

### Current Runtime Control And Observation Surfaces

Key observation structs include:

- `RuntimeControlSnapshot`
- `RuntimeTimelineSnapshot`
- `RuntimeAutomationSnapshot`
- `RuntimeEngineBlockSnapshot`
- `RuntimeTransportConcurrencySnapshot`
- `RuntimeSupervisionSnapshot`
- `RuntimeDiagnosticsSnapshot`

Current control-state tracking includes:

- handshake/configure/start/stop/restart counts
- last client version
- last stop reason
- last reconfigure request
- current readiness state
- effective runtime config

Current timeline tracking includes:

- next block sequence
- block-sequence continuity
- transport epoch
- last transport transition kind
- transport start/stop/seek/tempo/loop transitions
- last engine block start/end sample positions
- loop-wrap count

Current automation tracking includes:

- parameter event and modulation counts
- gesture counts
- first/last values
- first/last epochs
- segment counts and lease rollovers

## Runtime Scheduler And Prework

Current engine snapshot features:

- graph/planning summary mirrored from `signal-graph`
- scheduler topology summary for track lanes, bus groups, send/return groups,
  and console groups
- anticipative planning and dispatch counts
- prepared-dispatch versus realtime-dispatch metrics
- prework cache state, queue depth, and queue capacity
- pending-target backlog by class:
  - `Immediate`
  - `NearTerm`
  - `Deferred`
- prework service state:
  - `Disabled`
  - `Idle`
  - `Pending`
  - `Servicing`
  - `Yielding`
  - `Paused`
  - `Starved`
- prework service pressure:
  - `Normal`
  - `Elevated`
  - `Critical`
- semantic service policy:
  - `Balanced`
  - `LatencyFocused`
  - `PluginConstrained`
- plugin-gating and transport-gating counters
- service-cycle, throttle, yield, pause, resume, and starvation counters
- forecast mode, profile, and policy visibility

Current runtime scheduling behavior:

- runtime derives future execution targets from runtime-owned forecast state
- pending future targets are serviced separately from current realtime block
  application
- compatible queued prework can be preserved while incompatible entries are
  invalidated or retired
- prework freshness is tracked in block-sequence space
- transport transitions and parameter-batch application can invalidate queued
  prework

## Runtime Transport Concurrency

Current transport-concurrency surface includes:

- active session tracking for steady-state and recovery-overlap attaches
- lingering cleanup planning and queue receipts
- pending cleanup-wave summaries
- cleanup attempt counters and cleanup error visibility
- peak attached, overlap, and lingering session counts

Current behavior:

- runtime remains authoritative for session admission state
- lingering cleanup work is runtime-queued and processing-epoch aware
- cleanup plans are emitted as typed runtime work rather than raw host-local
  snapshot interpretation

## What Is Implemented Versus Planned

Implemented now:

- routed executable graph plans with explicit node contracts and bus routing
- planning groups, execution lanes, and dispatch-order reporting
- block-local sample-offset parameter-event application
- runtime-owned graph execution and engine-block observation
- runtime-owned anticipative prework forecasting, queueing, and service-state
  reporting
- runtime-owned transport concurrency and lingering-cleanup workflow surfaces

Planned elsewhere but not implemented in these crates yet:

- broader multichannel adaptation beyond mono/stereo
- richer graph stage catalogs and plugin-hosted stage execution inside
  `signal-graph` itself
- a production-grade multithreaded scheduler rather than the current embeddable
  block-processing shell
- narrower, more task-specific runtime docs for each control subsystem

## Current Entry Points

Useful implementation entry points after this doc:

- `crates/signal-graph/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/signal-runtime/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/signal-runtime/src/interfaces.rs`
- `crates/signal-runtime/src/runtime.rs`
- `crates/signal-runtime/examples/supervisor_report_demo.rs`

## Next Task

Add API-local examples that exercise `ExecutableGraph` and `SignalRuntime`
directly so the current-state graph/runtime reference is backed by runnable
usage paths, not only architecture summaries.
